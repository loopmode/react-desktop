# static/extensions

This folder contains chrome extensions for convenience.

To add an extension, install it in chrome, then read https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/devtools-extension on how to find relevant files.
Copy the files into this folder, then register the extension extension in `src/main/chrome-extensions.js`.
